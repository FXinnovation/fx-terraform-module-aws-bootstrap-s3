# Standard S3 reposiory for terraform

Configuration in this directory creates set of S3 resources to be used for terraformâ€™s state files.

## Usage

To run this example you need to execute:

```bash
$ terraform init
$ terraform plan
$ terraform apply
```

Note that this example may create resources which can cost money (AWS Elastic IP, for example). Run `terraform destroy` when you don't need these resources.
